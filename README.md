# Admin

This is a Admin template build with Angular and CSS

It's based on https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_analytics.htm

I will use this for talks and demoing the Angular CLI

### Play with it

- clone and npm istall it to your computer.
- run `npm run rest` to start the backend
- run `ng s` to kick of the dev Server
